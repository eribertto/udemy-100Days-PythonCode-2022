FAQ: Can I Use PyCharm/VSCode/ Another Local Code Editor?
On day 15 of the course, I will show you how to install and set up PyCharm, the most popular Python local code editor.

In the meantime (between day 1 and day 15) we will be using Replit a browser-based code editor. This has a number of advantages:

1. We can get up and running immediately, with less time wasted on setup and troubleshooting, more time learning to code.

2. It's accessible anywhere, any computer/iPad/phone that's connected to the internet can be used to code.

3. Your code and progress are saved, ready for you to review and revisit at any time.

4. It's free.



If you already have PyCharm or another code editor installed, feel free to use it. But the videos are recorded with replit so you might have a harder time trying to figure out how to do something in your local editor. But if you are advanced then feel free to choose.

I recommend everyone start with replit as I do in the videos and to follow along. As a developer, we need to learn to use many tools and the more your know the better. Then when we reach day 15, we will learn to use PyCharm. Even if you have a preferred tool, you might find something new.
